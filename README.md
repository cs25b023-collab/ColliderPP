# Collider++
 This is part of Proramming Club IITM, Mini Project, for Deputy Coordinators 25-26

## Desc:
This project focuses on building a robust and efficient collision detection and resolution system for complex, non-trivial objects. It targets advanced shapes such as concave polygons and objects bounded by mathematical curves, going beyond basic line and convex geometry.

The engine will implement industry-standard techniques including Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB), the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT), and spatial partitioning to achieve accurate and high-performance collision handling. Emphasis is placed on clean, efficient implementations and a clear separation between broad-phase and narrow-phase collision detection.

If time permits, the project will be extended with a basic physics system and a custom render pipeline using OpenGL to visualize geometry, collisions, and physical interactions.
